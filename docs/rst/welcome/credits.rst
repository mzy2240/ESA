The authors of ESA would like to give a special thank you to our users.
Additionally, we've received help from some of our colleagues along the
way, including (but not limited to!) Wei Trinh, Diana Wallison and Xiangtian Zheng.
Thank you!

We hope you enjoy using ESA as much as we've enjoyed creating it.

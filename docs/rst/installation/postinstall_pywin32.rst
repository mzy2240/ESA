From the `pywin32 GitHub page <https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32>`__:

    Note that if you want to use pywin32 for "system wide" features,
    such as registering COM objects or implementing Windows Services,
    then you must run the following command from an elevated command
    prompt:

        python Scripts/pywin32_postinstall.py -install

Note that the aforementioned "Scripts" directory can be found inside
your virtual environment directory.

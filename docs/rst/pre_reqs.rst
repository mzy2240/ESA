-  Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System (PowerWorld is Windows only).
-  PowerWorld Simulator with SimAuto add-on installed.
-  `Git Large File Storage (LFS) <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`__
   (**OPTIONAL**: required to download case files and run tests). After
   installing Git LFS, simply change directories to this repository, and
   run ``git lfs install``. You will likely need to run a ``git pull``
   or ``git lfs pull`` after installing and setting up Git LFS. After
   initial setup, you shouldn't need to do anything else with Git LFS.
-  Python >=3.5.

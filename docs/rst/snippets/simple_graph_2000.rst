This example shows how to easily transform a grid model into a graph
supported by NetworkX. NetworkX is a popular Python package for
analyzing graph structure, building network models and designing new
network algorithms. You'll first need to install NetworkX into your
virtual environment (which should be activated!), which is most easily
done by:

.. code:: bat

    python -m pip install networkx

Before following along with the example, define the ``CASE_PATH``
constant like so, adapting the path to your system:

.. code:: python

    CASE_PATH = r"C:\Users\myuser\git\ESA\tests\cases\tx2000\tx2000_base.PWB"

On to the example!

Perform imports, initialize a ``SAW`` instance:

.. code:: python

    >>> from esa import SAW
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> saw = SAW(CASE_PATH, early_bind=True)

Get a DataFrame with all branches (lines, transformers, etc.):

.. code:: python

    >>> kf = saw.get_key_field_list('branch')
    >>> kf
    ['BusNum', 'BusNum:1', 'LineCircuit']
    >>> branch_df = saw.GetParametersMultipleElement('branch', kf)
    >>> branch_df
          BusNum  BusNum:1 LineCircuit
    0       1001      1064           1
    1       1001      1064           2
    2       1001      1071           1
    3       1001      1071           2
    4       1002      1007           1
    ...      ...       ...         ...
    3199    8157      5124           1
    3200    8157      8156           1
    3201    8158      8030           1
    3202    8159      8158           1
    3203    8160      8159           1
    <BLANKLINE>
    [3204 rows x 3 columns]

Create the graph from the DataFrame. Yes, it is this simple. Use
``Graph`` instead of ``MultiGraph`` if there are no parallel branches.

.. code:: python

    >>> graph = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(branch_df, "BusNum", "BusNum:1", create_using=nx.MultiGraph)
    >>> graph.number_of_nodes()
    2000
    >>> graph.number_of_edges()
    3204

Clean up:

.. code:: python

    saw.exit()

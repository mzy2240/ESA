Use this directory to store PowerWorld cases for testing. Make sure the
cases are public - don't share any private cases!

ieee_14
-------

IEEE 14-bus test case downloaded from `here <https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/ieee-14-bus-system/>`__
on 2019-09-25.

tx2000
------

This directory contains a variant of the Texas 2000 bus synthetic 
grid. You can find a version of this model (though possibly not
identical) on Texas A&M's `website <https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/>`__.
This particular case was provided by `Adam Birchfield <http://adambirchfield.com/>`__.

tx2000_mod
----------

This directory contains a variant of the Texas 2000 bus synthetic grid
modified for voltage control experiments. This case was provided by
Diana Wallison (diwalli@tamu.edu).

wscc_9
------

This directory contains an approximation of the Western System
Coordinating Council (WSCC) system. This model is commonly used for
dynamics simulations. It was `downloaded from Texas A&M
<https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/wscc-9-bus-system/>`__
on 2020-04-01.
